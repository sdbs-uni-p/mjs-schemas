# mjs-schemas
A collection of schemas in the JSON Schema language with static and dynamic references, designed to challenge validators.

We provide three families of schemas that have been designed to be universally satisfiable, so the JSON instance `null` validates against them.

The schemas are further described in the article **"Validation of Modern JSON Schema: Formalization and Complexity"** [available as technical report on ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10034)
by Lyes Attouche, Mohamed-Amine Baazizi, Dario Colazzo, Giorgio Ghelli, Carlo Sartiani, and Stefanie Scherzinger (2023).
